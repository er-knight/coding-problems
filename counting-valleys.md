#### Problem :point_down:
An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly `steps`, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, `U`, or a downhill, `D` step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a `1` unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:  
- A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.  
- A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.  

Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through. 
#### Sample Input :point_down:
```
steps = 8
path = UDDDUDUU
```
#### Sample Output :point_down:
```
1
```
#### Explanation :point_down:
If we represent `_` as sea level, a step up as `/`, and a step down as `\`, the hike can be drawn as:  
```
_/\      _
   \    /
    \/\/
```
The hiker enters and leaves one valley.
