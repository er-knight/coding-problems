#### Problem :point_down:
You are given a string `s` containing `1`s and `0`s. Return the number of substrings that contain only `1`s.
#### Sample Input :point_down:
```
s = "111001"
```
#### Sample Output :point_down:
```
7
```
#### Explanation :point_down:
Here are all the substrings containing only `1`s:
```
ðŸ‘‰ "1"
ðŸ‘‰ "1"
ðŸ‘‰ "1"
ðŸ‘‰ "1"
ðŸ‘‰ "11"
ðŸ‘‰ "11"
ðŸ‘‰ "111"
```

#### Python :point_down:
```py
def solve(s):
    c = 0
    t = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            t += 1
        else:
            c += (t * (t+1))//2
            t = 0

    c += (t * (t+1))//2

    return c
```  
#### Python :point_down:
```py
def solve(s):
    return sum([(len(i) * (len(i)+1))//2 for i in s.split('0')])
```  
#### Time Complexity :point_down:
